**Cross-Out Puzzle**

A cross-out puzzle consists of a rectangular grid of symbols. The goal is to cross out certain symbols to satisfy all of the following conditions:

- Uniqueness in Rows and Columns
No symbol should appear more than once in a row or a column.
(Crossed-out occurrences do not count.)

- Separation of Crossed-Out Symbols
Crossed-out symbols must not be adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically.

- Contiguity of Remaining Symbols
All symbols that are not crossed out should form a contiguous area. This means each non-crossed-out symbol should be reachable from every other non-crossed-out symbol by moving horizontally or vertically only over non-crossed-out symbols.
